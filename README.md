# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

When it is time to apply for jobs, I will need a portfolio to provide the projects I have worked on to employers. The projects shows a developer's skill and talent. Creating this portfolio as a student allows us to practice what we have learned thus far such as flexbox, media queries, and css variables. As the bootcamp continues on, we can add to the portfolio to showcase our projects. Also, as we become better with coding we can improve the layout of the portfolio as we wish.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

There are three sections to this portfolio which include about me, work, and contact information. There are links at the top right in the header that will bring the user to each said section. The "about me" section includes a photo and a brief description. The section below will show a grid placeholder pictures of where future projects will go. At the bottom, there are links that the user can use to contact me through email, github, and linkedin.
